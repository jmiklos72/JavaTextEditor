# JavaTextEditor
Creating a simple text editor in Java. May be expanded upon later.

Going to start with bare bones and then hopefully expand to add features that common text editors have.
Much later will try and add themes (try and be more comlex than just a light and dark theme).

Going to be written in Java using Eclipse IDE.
